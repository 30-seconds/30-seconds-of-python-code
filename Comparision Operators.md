`Comparison Operators`


In this we will be learning about Comparison Operators in Python. These operators will allow us to compare variables and output a Boolean value (True or False).

If you have any sort of background in Math, these operators should be very straight forward.

First we'll present a table of the comparison operators and then work through some examples:

Table of Comparison Operators 
In the table below, a=3 and b=4.

 Operator Description	Example
==	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	(a == b) is not true.
!=	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true
>	If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a > b) is not true.
<	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a < b) is true.
>=	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a >= b) is not true.
<=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a <= b) is true.
Let's now work through quick examples of each of these.

Equal
`2 == 2`
True
`1 == 0`
False

Note that == is a comparison operator, while = is an assignment operator.

Not Equal
`2 != 1`
True
`2 != 2`
False
Greater Than
`2 > 1`
True
`2 > 4`
False
Less Than
`2 < 4`
True
`2 < 1`
False

Greater Than or Equal to
`2 >= 2`
True
`2 >= 1`
True

Less than or Equal to
`2 <= 2`
True
`2 <= 4`
True
Great! Go over each comparison operator to make sure you understand what each one is saying. But hopefully this was straightforward for you.
