Rather than writing for loops and writing a compare function to sort a list based on item frequency, the following code snippet can be used easily. 
collections is a default module of python, that contains "Counter method", that return counter object.


##code

counts = collections.Counter(lst)

new_list = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: -counts[x])

print(new_list)
